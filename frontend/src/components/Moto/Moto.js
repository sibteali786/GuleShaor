          <p>
            Pakistan has an extraordinary asset in the shape of a youth bulge,
            which means that the largest segment of our population consists of
            young people - around 63%. This youth bulge can translate into
            economic gains only if the youth have skills consistent with the
            requirements of a modern economy. Because of increasing population
            growth, Pakistan is facing difficulty in providing sufficient
            employment opportunities. The issue is becoming more serious with
            rapidly changing economies that require more innovative skills.

            Our students getting professional education need to be updated about
            the latest market trends, their personalities need to be flexible
            and adaptive in order to exploit the market opportunities both at
            national and international level. So we are creating a demand-driven
            training system responsive to requirements of the job market that
            will enable youth to not depend on the government but make a living
            through freelancing and entrepreneurship. The system provides not
            only expert industrial mentorship and career counseling but also the
            awareness of free high quality learning resources over the internet
            and career opportunities.
